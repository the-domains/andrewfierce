# Minimalism: a practice in clear thinking.
![A practice in clear thinking. ](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8793bdec3ce76ecf714ac802ec5c90a63a9bb288.jpg)

I decided to do something seemingly absurd. I bagged up all of my clothes and donated them to the local thrift store, opting instead to wear the same outfit for a year.

That was over a year ago.

And I will continue to wear one thing a year for the forseable future.

Here's why.

Experience greater peace.

We are conditioned to run the hedonist treadmill and that takes a significant amount of mental effort. Consuming is more taxing than producing and doubly so when compared to giving). By eliminating all other clothing and reducing it down to an essential outfit you short circuit the hedonist treadmill and the created "needs" most associated with fast fashion.

Be more focused and creative.

When we think about the objects we own, they don't just take up physical space, time, money, and energy. They do all of that, but they also take up space in the mind.

Think of it this way:

Imagine trying to bounce one hundred colored balls so that no ball is motionless. To do so for any length of tine would be absolutely exhausting. The mental drain is almost unimaginable. In a similar way, the more objects you own, the more distributed your attention becomes, correlating to a general hollowing out of focus, and of over all satisfaction.

Discover deeper meaning in your life.

You find yourself more present, more connected, more generous, more open to new experiences (you tend to value experiences much more highly than objects). In a word, you become meaningful.

Now to more practical concerns.

Your brain has likely been giving you a series of objections throughout this post. Allow me to address the key ones:

"_People will think I am a slob for wearing the same thing everyday."_

People rarely noticed that I wore the same thing everyday and if they did it was a great opening for a story.

"_What about seasonality?"_

_"Occasion?"_

_"The overbearing idea of etc?"_

Here is how I do it. It's not a one size fits all, but I think it will serve as a potent description to eliminate these objections (_fears_).

I stick to black and white only. I wear a white linen t-shirt and a trouser/jogger that fits nicely. I wear a trainer (like the Nike Sock Dart for example) for most occasions (because of its all around functionality and look).

* I could hike around Yellowstone in the Summer in the above outfit.

* I could comfortably endure the rains of Seattle by adding a windbreaker.

* I could enjoy the wintry festivities of Jackson Hole by layering with a sweater and Coat.

* I could dress it up for a New Years Party by wearing a black brogue and a slimming black sweater.

The possibilities are endless and easy. I routinely get compliments on my outfit.

The hardest part is the leap.

What are you waiting for?

Meaning is all around you when you realize there is no ground to crash on.
